#Meetme
A polymer app using Firebase and Google Map Api.
Intro
------
The purpose of this app is to provide a shared synchronized location service for meeting a group of people. Let's say you want to have a coffee with friends in the Starbucks. You told your friends to meet with you in the front door of Starbucks at 5pm. However there happened to be two Starbucks in your area. To avoid confusion, you can set a destination tag using this app and share it with your friends. Your current location is also tracked and shown on the map together with your friends' location. This way, you and your friends can all find each other as soon as possible.
